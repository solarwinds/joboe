/**
 * Logger stream that writes to a File via a FileChannel
 * <p>
 * This implements a rolling behavior which rolls the log file and create backup files up to `maxBackup` if
 * the current log file size exceeds `maxSize`.
 * <p>
 * Take note that multiple java processes might run this logger and the rolling operation should be blocking across
 * processes so that the log file should only be rolled once.
 * <p>
 * If another process has rolled the file, the current logger might still write to the renamed (rolled) file for a
 * short while but should be switching to the new log file eventually. However, it is guaranteed that no log should
 * be lost if the rolling is done by another process.
