Take note that this project has Kamon monitoring integrated. To run with Kamon, simply:
1. Execute activator or sbt
2. Within the activator/sbt console, type 
 aspectj-runner:run 

To disable all Kamon:
1. comment out code from Gloabl.scala (or just remove the class)
2. comment out the Kamon plugin references in the build.sbt
3. comment out the Kamon plugin reference in project/plugins.sbt

To disable the Kamon module that uses aspectJ (that might conflict with our agent)
1. Within the activator/sbt console, instead of "aspectj-runner:run", simply do
 run
2. You will see a big warning saying the AspectJ Weaver is not running. This is expected
