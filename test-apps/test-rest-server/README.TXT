This is a sample REST server. Please build the war using the pom file

The server is accessible by default at http://<host>/test-rest-server/

optionally, a query parameter duration could be added to control the process time (in ms) on the server

for example:
http://localhost:8080/test-rest-server/abc?duration=1000

will result in a 1 sec wait
