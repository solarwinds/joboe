This project contains basic Play 2 (Java template) operations

Preq: java 7 

In order deploy and test this project:
1. Download and install Play 2 - http://www.playframework.com/download (this was developed against version 2.2.3, but probably will work on most play 2 versions)
2. Modify under the Play 2 installation directory : <play directory>\framework\build (or build.bat on windows). Before the line of running java command add:
for Windows:
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:"C:\Program Files\AppNeta\TraceView\java\tracelyticsagent.jar"
for Linux:
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tracelytics/tracelyticsagent.jar"
3. In command line mode, navigate to the directory of this testing project
4.1 To test on Dev mode, type "play run"
4.2 To test on Prod mode
 4.2.1 Type "play dist", play should build the distribution and place a zip file under target/universal
 4.2.2 Copy the zip file under target/universal to a location of your choice and unzip it
 4.2.3 Navigate to the unzipped folder
 For windows:
 1.Modify the bin\test-play-java.bat, insert set _JAVA_OPTS=%_JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:"C:\Program Files\AppNeta\TraceView\java\tracelyticsagent.jar" before the java command is executed
 2.Start by bin\java.bat
 For Linux:
 1.Start by bin/java -J-javaagent:/usr/local/tracelytics/tracelyticsagent.jar (for 2.2+) bin/test-play-java -javaagent:/usr/local/tracelytics/tracelyticsagent.jar (for 2.0 - 2.1)
5. Goto your browser the server is accessible via http://localhost:9000/


Below are the URLs for testing
GET     /                           simple index page
GET     /file                       returns a file
GET     /chunked                    returns a file in chunks
GET     /exception					throws an exception
GET     /wait/<n>                   waits for <n> milliseconds
GET     /async                      runs async operation (only instrumented the netty layer and the submission of the async task)
POST    /post                       post a form

To test websocket: (only instrumented the netty layer)
1. Goto http://www.websocket.org/echo.html
2. In the location field, enter ws://localhost:9000/websocket
3. Click connect. You should see Hello in the Log area on that page

Other test cases:
To test more complicated testcases. Simply goto the "samples/java" under play installation folder. There are several projects suitable for testing, for example computer-database and zentasks.
