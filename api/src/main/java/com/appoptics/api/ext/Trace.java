/**
 * API for initiating traces and creating events, for use by non-web / background apps, etc.
 * <p>
 * A Trace is a unit of instrumented work, usually mapped to a web request.
 * <p>
 * Each trace consists of exactly one top span, more spans can be added below and each of those spans can contain multiple "spans" which are marked by exactly one entry and exit event and optionally info events in between. A span usually represents duration of an operation.
